## 1.1.0

Major update to CodeceptJS. **NodeJS v 8.9.1** is now minimal Node version required.
This brings native async-await support to CodeceptJS. It is recommended to start using await for tests instead of generators:

```js
async () => {
  I.amOnPage('/page');
  const url = await I.grabTextFrom('.nextPage');
  I.amOnPage(url);
}
```

Thanks to [@Apshenkin](https://github.com/apshenkin) for implementation. Also, most helpers were refactored to use async-await. This made our code simpler. We hope that this encourages more users to send pull requests!

We also introduced strict ESLint policies for our codebase. Thanks to [@Galkin](https://github.com/galkin) for that.

* **[Puppeteer] Helper introduced**. [Learn how to run tests headlessly with Google Chrome's Puppeteer](http://codecept.io/puppeteer/).
* [SeleniumWebdriver] Helper is deprecated, it is recommended to use Protractor with config option `angular: false` instead.
* [WebDriverIO] nested iframe support in the within block by @reubenmiller. Example:

```js
within({frame: ['#wrapperId', '[name=content]']}, () => {
  I.click('Sign in!');
  I.see('Email Address');
});
I.see('Nested Iframe test');
I.dontSee('Email Address');
});
```
* [WebDriverIO] Support for `~` locator to find elements by `aria-label`. This behavior is similar as it is in Appium and helps testing cross-platform React apps. Example:

```html
<Text accessibilityLabel="foobar">
    CodeceptJS is awesome
</Text>
```
â†‘ This element can be located with `~foobar` in WebDriverIO and Appium helpers. Thanks to @flyskywhy

* Allow providing arbitrary objects in config includes by @rlewan
* [REST] Prevent from mutating default headers by @alexashley. See [#789](https://github.com/Codeception/CodeceptJS/pull/789)

  * Use uuid in screenshot names when `uniqueScreenshotNames: true`
* [Protractor] Fixed testing non-angular application. `amOutsideAngularApp` is executed before each step. Fixes [#458](https://github.com/Codeception/CodeceptJS/issues/458)

## 1.0

CodeceptJS hits first stable release. CodeceptJS provides a unified API for [web testing for Webdriverio](http://codecept.io/acceptance/), [Protractor](http://codecept.io/angular/), and [NightmareJS](http://codecept.io/nightmare/). Since 1.0 you can also **test mobile applications** in the similar manner with Appium.

Sample test:

```js
I.seeAppIsInstalled("io.super.app");
I.click('~startUserRegistrationCD');
I.fillField('~email of the customer', 'Nothing special'));
I.see('davert@codecept.io', '~email of the customer'));
I.clearField('~email of the customer'));
I.dontSee('Nothing special', '~email of the customer'));
```

* Read [the Mobile Testing guide](http://codecept.io/mobile).
* Discover [Appium Helper](http://codecept.io/helpers/Appium/)

---

We also introduced two new helpers for data management.
Using them you can easily prepare and cleanup data for your tests using public REST API.

Sample test

```js
// create a user using data factories and REST API
I.have('user', { name: 'davert', password: '123456' });
// use it to login
I.amOnPage('/login');
I.fillField('login', 'davert');
I.fillField('password', '123456');
I.click('Login');
I.see('Hello, davert');
// user will be removed after the test
```

* Read [Data Management guide](http://codecept.io/data)
* [REST Helper](http://codecept.io/helpers/REST)
* [ApiDataFactory](http://codecept.io/helpers/ApiDataFactory/)

---

Next notable feature is **[SmartWait](http://codecept.io/acceptance/#smartwait)** for WebDriverIO, Protractor, SeleniumWebdriver. When `smartwait` option is set, script will wait for extra milliseconds to locate an element before failing. This feature uses implicit waits of Selenium but turns them on only in applicable pieces. For instance, implicit waits are enabled for `seeElement` but disabled for `dontSeeElement`
