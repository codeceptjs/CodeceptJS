    Before: 3 // retry Before 3 times
    Scenario: 3 // retry Scenario 3 times
  }, 
  {
    // retry less when running slow tests
    grep: '@slow' 
    Scenario: 1
    Before: 1

    // retry all BeforeSuite 3 times
    BeforeSuite: 3
  }
]

## 3.3.0

üõ©Ô∏è Features:

* [**API Testing introduced**](/api)
  * Introduced [`JSONResponse`](/helpers/JSONResponse) helper which connects to REST, GraphQL or Playwright helper
  * [REST] Added `amBearerAuthenticated` method
  * [REST] Added `haveRequestHeaders` method
  * Added dependency on `joi` and `chai`
* [Playwright] Added `timeout` option to set [timeout](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-set-default-timeout) for all Playwright actions. If an action fails, Playwright keeps retrying it for a time set by timeout.
* [Playwright] **Possible breaking change.** By default `timeout` is set to 1000ms. *Previous default was set by Playwright internally to 30s. This was causing contradiction to CodeceptJS retries, so triggered up to 3 retries for 30s of time. This timeout option was lowered so retryFailedStep plugin would not cause long delays.*
* [Playwright] Updated `restart` config option to include 3 restart strategies:
  * 'context' or **false** - restarts [browser context](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext) but keeps running browser. Recommended by Playwright team to keep tests isolated.
  * 'browser' or **true** - closes browser and opens it again between tests.
  * 'session' or 'keep' - keeps browser context and session, but cleans up cookies and localStorage between tests. The fastest option when running tests in windowed mode. Works with `keepCookies` and `keepBrowserState` options. This behavior was default prior CodeceptJS 3.1
* [Playwright] Extended methods to provide more options from engine. These methods were updated so additional options can be be passed as the last argument:
  * [`click`](/helpers/Playwright#click)
  * [`dragAndDrop`](/helpers/Playwright#dragAndDrop)
  * [`checkOption`](/helpers/Playwright#checkOption)
  * [`uncheckOption`](/helpers/Playwright#uncheckOption)

```js
// use Playwright click options as 3rd argument
I.click('canvas', '.model', { position: { x: 20, y: 40 } })
// check option also has options
I.checkOption('Agree', '.signup', { position: { x: 5, y: 5 } })
```

* `eachElement` plugin introduced. It allows you to iterate over elements and perform some action on them using direct engines API

```js
await eachElement('click all links in .list', '.list a', (el) => {
  await el.click();
})
```
* [Playwright] Added support to `playwright-core` package if `playwright` is not installed. See #3190, fixes #2663.
* [Playwright] Added `makeApiRequest` action to perform API requests. Requires Playwright >= 1.18
* Added support to `codecept.config.js` for name consistency across other JS tools. See motivation at #3195 by @JiLiZART 
* [ApiDataFactory] Added options arg to `have` method. See #3197 by @JJlokidoki
* Improved pt-br translations to include keywords: 'Funcionalidade', 'Cen√°rio', 'Antes', 'Depois', 'AntesDaSuite', 'DepoisDaSuite'. See #3206 by @danilolutz 
* [allure plugin] Introduced `addStep` method to add comments and attachments. See #3104 by @EgorBodnar

## 3.2.2

* [Playwright] Reverted removal of retry on context errors. Fixes #3130
* Timeout improvements by @nikocanvacom:
  * Added priorites to timeouts
  * Added `overrideStepLimits` to [stepTimeout plugin](https://codecept.io/plugins/#steptimeout) to override steps timeouts set by `limitTime`.
  * Fixed step timeout not working due to override by NaN by test timeout #3126
* [Appium] Fixed logging error when `manualStart` is true. See #3140 by @nikocanvacom


## 3.2.1

> ‚ôªÔ∏è This release fixes hanging of tests by reducing timeouts for automatic retries on failures.

* [retryFailedStep plugin] **New Defaults**: retries steps up to 3 times with factor of 1.5 (previously 5 with factor 2)

  * test timeouts (via `Scenario` and `Feature` options)
    * _Breaking change:_ `Feature().timeout()` and `Scenario().timeout()` calls has no effect and are deprecated

```js
// set timeout for every test in suite to 10 secs
Feature('tests with timeout', { timeout: 10 });

// set timeout for this test to 20 secs
Scenario('a test with timeout', { timeout: 20 }, ({ I }) => {});
```  

  * step timeouts (See #3059 by @nikocanvacom)

```js
// set step timeout to 5 secs
I.limitTime(5).click('Link');
```  
 * `stepTimeout` plugin introduced to automatically add timeouts for each step (#3059 by @nikocanvacom).

[**retryTo**](/plugins/#retryto) plugin introduced to rerun a set of steps on failure:

```js
// editing in text in iframe
// if iframe was not loaded - retry 5 times
await retryTo(() => {
  I.switchTo('#editor frame');
  I.fillField('textarea', 'value');
}, 5);
```

## 3.0.0-beta.4

üêõ Bug Fix:
  * PageObject was broken when using "this" inside a simple object.
  * The typings for all WebDriver methods work correctly.
  * The typings for "this.helper" and helper constructor work correctly, too.

üß§ Internal:
 * Our TS Typings will be tested now! We strarted using [dtslint](https://github.com/microsoft/dtslint) to check all typings and all rules for linter.
 Example:
  ```ts
  const psp = wd.grabPageScrollPosition() // $ExpectType Promise<PageScrollPosition>
  psp.then(
    result => {
      result.x // $ExpectType number
      result.y // $ExpectType number
    }
  )
  ```
 * And last: Reducing package size from 3.3Mb to 2.0Mb

## 3.0.0-beta-3

* **BREAKING** Replaced bootstrap/teardown scripts to accept only functions or async functions. Async function with callback (with done parameter) should be replaced with async/await. [See our upgrde guide](https://bit.ly/codecept3Up).
* Test artifacts introduced. Each test object has `artifacts` property, to keep attachment files. For instance, a screenshot of a failed test is attached to a test as artifact.
* Improved output for test execution
  * Changed colors for steps output, simplified
  * Added stack trace for test failures
  * Removed `Event emitted` from log in `--verbose` mode
  * List artifacts of a failed tests

* Steps & metasteps refactored by @Vorobeyko. Logs to arguments passed to page objects:

```js
// TEST:
MyPage.hasFiles('first arg', 'second arg');

// OUTPUT:
MyPage: hasFile "First arg", "Second arg"
  I see file "codecept.js"
  I see file "codecept.po.json"
```
* Introduced official [TypeScript boilerplate](https://github.com/codeceptjs/typescript-boilerplate). Started by @Vorobeyko.

## 3.0.0-beta


* **NodeJS 12+ required**
* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Syntax for tests has changed.


```js

```js
I.usePlaywrightTo('do something special', async ({ page }) => {
  // use page or browser objects here
});
```

```js
I.usePuppeteerTo('do something special', async ({ page, browser }) => {
  // use page or browser objects here
});
```

```js
I.useWebDriverTo('do something special', async ({ browser }) => {
  // use browser object here
});
```

* `tryTo` plugin introduced. Allows conditional action execution:

```js
const isSeen = await tryTo(() => {
  I.see('Some text');
});
// we are not sure if cookie bar is displayed, but if so - accept cookies
tryTo(() => I.click('Accept', '.cookies'));
```

Basic feature file:

```gherkin
Feature: Business rules
  In order to achieve my goals
  As a persona
  I want to be able to interact with a system

  Scenario: do anything in my life
    Given I need to open Google
```

Step definition:

```js
const I = actor();

Given('I need to open Google', () => {
  I.amOnPage('https://google.com');
});
```

Run it with `--features --steps` flag:

```
codeceptjs run --steps --features
```

---

* **Brekaing Chnage** `run` command now uses relative path + test name to run exactly one test file.

Previous behavior (removed):
```
codeceptjs run basic_test.js
```
Current behavior (relative path to config + a test name)

```
codeceptjs run tests/basic_test.js
```
This change allows using auto-completion when running a specific test.

---

## 1.2.1

* Fixed running `I.retry()` on multiple steps.
* Fixed parallel execution wih chunks.
* [Puppeteer] Fixed `grabNumberOfVisibleElements` to return `0` instead of throwing error if no elements are found.

## 1.2.0

* [WebDriverIO][Protractor][Multiple Sessions](https://codecept.io/acceptance/#multiple-sessions). Run several browser sessions in one test. Introduced `session` command, which opens additional browser window and closes it after a test.

```js
Scenario('run in different browsers', (I) => {
  I.amOnPage('/hello');
  I.see('Hello!');
  session('john', () => {
    I.amOnPage('/bye');
    I.dontSee('Hello');
    I.see('Bye');
  });
  I.see('Hello');
});
```

* [Parallel Execution](https://codecept.io/advanced/#parallel-execution) by @sveneisenschmidt. Run tests in parallel specifying number of chunks:

```js
"multiple": {
  "parallel": {
    // run in 2 processes
    "chunks": 2,
    // run all tests in chrome
    "browsers": ["chrome"]
  },
}
```

* [Locator Builder](https://codecept.io/locators). Write complex locators with simplest API combining CSS and XPath:

```js
// select 'Edit' link inside 2nd row of a table
locate('//table')
  .find('tr')
  .at(2)
  .find('a')
  .withText('Edit');
```

* [Dynamic configuration](https://codecept.io/advanced/#dynamic-configuration) to update helpers config per test or per suite.
* Added `event.test.finished` which fires synchronously for both failed and passed tests.
* [WebDriverIO][Protractor][Nightmare][Puppeteer] Full page screenshots on failure disabled by default. See [issue#1600. You can enabled them with `fullPageScreenshots: true`, however they may work unstable in Selenium.
* `within` blocks can return values. See [updated documentation](https://codecept.io/basics/#within).
* Removed doublt call to `_init` in helpers. Fixes issue #1036
* Added scenario and feature configuration via fluent API:

```js
Feature('checkout')
  .timeout(3000)
  .retry(2);

Scenario('user can order in firefox', (I) => {
  // see dynamic configuration
}).config({ browser: 'firefox' })
  .timeout(20000);

Scenario('this test should throw error', (I) => {
  // I.amOnPage
}).throws(new Error);
```

## 1.1.0

Major update to CodeceptJS. **NodeJS v 8.9.1** is now minimal Node version required.
This brings native async-await support to CodeceptJS. It is recommended to start using await for tests instead of generators:

```js
async () => {
  I.amOnPage('/page');
  const url = await I.grabTextFrom('.nextPage');
  I.amOnPage(url);
}
```

Thanks to [@Apshenkin](https://github.com/apshenkin) for implementation. Also, most helpers were refactored to use async-await. This made our code simpler. We hope that this encourages more users to send pull requests!

We also introduced strict ESLint policies for our codebase. Thanks to [@Galkin](https://github.com/galkin) for that.

* **[Puppeteer] Helper introduced**. [Learn how to run tests headlessly with Google Chrome's Puppeteer](http://codecept.io/puppeteer/).
* [SeleniumWebdriver] Helper is deprecated, it is recommended to use Protractor with config option `angular: false` instead.
* [WebDriverIO] nested iframe support in the within block by @reubenmiller. Example:

```js
within({frame: ['#wrapperId', '[name=content]']}, () => {
  I.click('Sign in!');
  I.see('Email Address');
});
I.see('Nested Iframe test');
I.dontSee('Email Address');
});
```
* [WebDriverIO] Support for `~` locator to find elements by `aria-label`. This behavior is similar as it is in Appium and helps testing cross-platform React apps. Example:

```html
<Text accessibilityLabel="foobar">
    CodeceptJS is awesome
</Text>
```
‚Üë This element can be located with `~foobar` in WebDriverIO and Appium helpers. Thanks to @flyskywhy

* Allow providing arbitrary objects in config includes by @rlewan
* [REST] Prevent from mutating default headers by @alexashley. See #789
* [REST] Fixed sending empty helpers with `haveRequestHeaders` in `sendPostRequest`. By @petrisorionel

  * Fixed #447 tests failed silently if they have the same name as other tests.
  * Use uuid in screenshot names when `uniqueScreenshotNames: true`
* [Protractor] Fixed testing non-angular application. `amOutsideAngularApp` is executed before each step. Fixes #458* Added output for steps in hooks when they fail

## 1.0.1

## 1.0

CodeceptJS hits first stable release. CodeceptJS provides a unified API for [web testing for Webdriverio](http://codecept.io/acceptance/), [Protractor](http://codecept.io/angular/), and [NightmareJS](http://codecept.io/nightmare/). Since 1.0 you can also **test mobile applications** in the similar manner with Appium.

Sample test:

```js
I.seeAppIsInstalled("io.super.app");
I.click('~startUserRegistrationCD');
I.fillField('~email of the customer', 'Nothing special'));
I.see('davert@codecept.io', '~email of the customer'));
I.clearField('~email of the customer'));
I.dontSee('Nothing special', '~email of the customer'));
```

* Read [the Mobile Testing guide](http://codecept.io/mobile).
* Discover [Appium Helper](http://codecept.io/helpers/Appium/)

---

We also introduced two new **helpers for data management**.
Using them you can easily prepare and cleanup data for your tests using public REST API.

Sample test

```js
// create a user using data factories and REST API
I.have('user', { name: 'davert', password: '123456' });
// use it to login
I.amOnPage('/login');
I.fillField('login', 'davert');
I.fillField('password', '123456');
I.click('Login');
I.see('Hello, davert');
// user will be removed after the test
```

* Read [Data Management guide](http://codecept.io/data)
* [REST Helper](http://codecept.io/helpers/REST)
* [ApiDataFactory](http://codecept.io/helpers/ApiDataFactory/)

---

Next notable feature is **[SmartWait](http://codecept.io/acceptance/#smartwait)** for WebDriverIO, Protractor, SeleniumWebdriver. When `smartwait` option is set, script will wait for extra milliseconds to locate an element before failing. This feature uses implicit waits of Selenium but turns them on only in applicable pieces. For instance, implicit waits are enabled for `seeElement` but disabled for `dontSeeElement`

* Read more about [SmartWait](http://codecept.io/acceptance/#smartwait)
