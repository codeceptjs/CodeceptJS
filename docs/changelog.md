## 3.4.0

* **Updated to latest mocha and modern Cucumber**
* **Allure plugin moved to [@codeceptjs/allure-legacy](https://github.com/codeceptjs/allure-legacy) package**. This happened because allure-commons package v1 was not updated and caused vulnarabilities. Fixes [#3422](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/issues/3422). We don't plan to maintain allure v2 plugin so it's up to community to take this initiative. Current allure plugin will print a warning message without interfering the run, so it won't accidentally fail your builds.
* Added ability to **[retry Before](https://codecept.io/basics/#retry-before), BeforeSuite, After, AfterSuite** hooks by **[davertmik](https://github.com/davertmik)**:
```js
Feature('flaky Before & BeforeSuite', { retryBefore: 2, retryBeforeSuite: 3 })
```

* **Flexible [retries configuration](https://codecept.io/basics/#retry-configuration) introduced** by **[davertmik](https://github.com/davertmik)**:

```js
retry: [
  {
    // enable this config only for flaky tests
    grep: '@flaky', 
    Before: 3 // retry Before 3 times
    Scenario: 3 // retry Scenario 3 times
  }, 
  {
    // retry less when running slow tests
    grep: '@slow' 
    Scenario: 1
    Before: 1
  }, {
    // retry all BeforeSuite 3 times
    BeforeSuite: 3
  }
]
```
* **Flexible [timeout configuration](https://codecept.io/advanced/#timeout-configuration)** introduced by **[davertmik](https://github.com/davertmik)**:

```js
timeout: [
  10, // default timeout is 10secs  
  {   // but increase timeout for slow tests
    grep: '@slow',
    Feature: 50
  },
]
```

* JsDoc: Removed promise from `I.say`. See [#3535](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/issues/3535) by **[danielrentz](https://github.com/danielrentz)**
* **[Playwright]** `handleDownloads` requires now a filename param. See [#3511](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/issues/3511) by **[PeterNgTr](https://github.com/PeterNgTr)**

## 3.3.0

üõ©Ô∏è Features:

* [**API Testing introduced**](/api)
  * Introduced [`JSONResponse`](/helpers/JSONResponse) helper which connects to REST, GraphQL or Playwright helper
  * **[REST]** Added `amBearerAuthenticated` method
  * **[REST]** Added `haveRequestHeaders` method
  * Added dependency on `joi` and `chai`
* **[Playwright]** Added `timeout` option to set [timeout](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-set-default-timeout) for all Playwright actions. If an action fails, Playwright keeps retrying it for a time set by timeout.
* **[Playwright]** **Possible breaking change.** By default `timeout` is set to 1000ms. *Previous default was set by Playwright internally to 30s. This was causing contradiction to CodeceptJS retries, so triggered up to 3 retries for 30s of time. This timeout option was lowered so retryFailedStep plugin would not cause long delays.*
* **[Playwright]** Updated `restart` config option to include 3 restart strategies:
  * 'context' or **false** - restarts [browser context](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext) but keeps running browser. Recommended by Playwright team to keep tests isolated.
  * 'browser' or **true** - closes browser and opens it again between tests.
  * 'session' or 'keep' - keeps browser context and session, but cleans up cookies and localStorage between tests. The fastest option when running tests in windowed mode. Works with `keepCookies` and `keepBrowserState` options. This behavior was default prior CodeceptJS 3.1
* **[Playwright]** Extended methods to provide more options from engine. These methods were updated so additional options can be be passed as the last argument:
  * [`click`](/helpers/Playwright#click)
  * [`dragAndDrop`](/helpers/Playwright#dragAndDrop)
  * [`checkOption`](/helpers/Playwright#checkOption)
  * [`uncheckOption`](/helpers/Playwright#uncheckOption)

```js
// use Playwright click options as 3rd argument
I.click('canvas', '.model', { position: { x: 20, y: 40 } })
// check option also has options
I.checkOption('Agree', '.signup', { position: { x: 5, y: 5 } })
```

* `eachElement` plugin introduced. It allows you to iterate over elements and perform some action on them using direct engines API

```js
await eachElement('click all links in .list', '.list a', (el) => {
  await el.click();
})
```
* **[Playwright]** Added support to `playwright-core` package if `playwright` is not installed. See [#3190](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/issues/3190), fixes [#2663](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/issues/2663).
* **[Playwright]** Added `makeApiRequest` action to perform API requests. Requires Playwright >= 1.18

## 3.0.0-rc



* Moved [Helper class into its own package](https://github.com/codeceptjs/helper) to simplify publishing standalone helpers.
* Fixed typings for `I.say` and `I.retry` by **[Vorobeyko](https://github.com/Vorobeyko)**
* Updated documentation:
  * [Quickstart](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/blob/codeceptjs-v3.0/docs/quickstart.md#quickstart)
  * [Best Practices](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/blob/codeceptjs-v3.0/docs/best.md)
  * [Custom Helpers](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/blob/codeceptjs-v3.0/docs/custom-helpers.md)
  * [TypeScript](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/blob/codeceptjs-v3.0/docs/typescript.md)

## 3.0.0-beta.4

üêõ Bug Fix:
  * PageObject was broken when using "this" inside a simple object.
  * The typings for all WebDriver methods work correctly.
  * The typings for "this.helper" and helper constructor work correctly, too.

üß§ Internal:
 * Our TS Typings will be tested now! We strarted using [dtslint](https://github.com/microsoft/dtslint) to check all typings and all rules for linter.
 Example:
  ```ts
  const psp = wd.grabPageScrollPosition() // $ExpectType Promise<PageScrollPosition>
  psp.then(
    result => {
      result.x // $ExpectType number
      result.y // $ExpectType number
    }
  )
  ```
 * And last: Reducing package size from 3.3Mb to 2.0Mb

## 3.0.0-beta-3

* **BREAKING** Replaced bootstrap/teardown scripts to accept only functions or async functions. Async function with callback (with done parameter) should be replaced with async/await. [See our upgrde guide](https://bit.ly/codecept3Up).
* Test artifacts introduced. Each test object has `artifacts` property, to keep attachment files. For instance, a screenshot of a failed test is attached to a test as artifact.
* Improved output for test execution
  * Changed colors for steps output, simplified
  * Added stack trace for test failures
  * Removed `Event emitted` from log in `--verbose` mode
  * List artifacts of a failed tests

* Steps & metasteps refactored by **[Vorobeyko](https://github.com/Vorobeyko)**. Logs to arguments passed to page objects:

```js
// TEST:
MyPage.hasFiles('first arg', 'second arg');

// OUTPUT:
MyPage: hasFile "First arg", "Second arg"
  I see file "codecept.js"
  I see file "codecept.po.json"
```
* Introduced official [TypeScript boilerplate](https://github.com/codeceptjs/typescript-boilerplate). Started by **[Vorobeyko](https://github.com/Vorobeyko)**.

## 3.0.0-beta


* **NodeJS 12+ required**
* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Syntax for tests has changed.


```js
// Previous
Scenario('title', (I, loginPage) => {});

// Current
Scenario('title', ({ I, loginPage }) => {});
```

* **BREAKING CHANGE:** [WebDriver][Protractor][Puppeteer][Playwright][Nightmare] `grab*` functions unified:
  * `grab*From` => **returns single value** from element or throws error when no matchng elements found
  * `grab*FromAll` => returns array of values, or empty array when no matching elements
* Public API for workers introduced by **[koushikmohan1996](https://github.com/koushikmohan1996)**. [Customize parallel execution](https://github.com/Codeception/CodeceptJS/blob/codeceptjs-v3.0/docs/parallel.md#custom-parallel-execution) with workers by building custom scripts.

* **[Playwright]** Added `usePlaywrightTo` method to access Playwright API in tests directly:

```js
I.usePlaywrightTo('do something special', async ({ page }) => {
  // use page or browser objects here
});
```

* **[Puppeteer]** Introduced `usePuppeteerTo` method to access Puppeteer API:

```js
I.usePuppeteerTo('do something special', async ({ page, browser }) => {
  // use page or browser objects here
});
```

* **[WebDriver]** Introduced `useWebDriverTo` method to access webdriverio API:

```js
I.useWebDriverTo('do something special', async ({ browser }) => {
  // use browser object here
});
```

* **[Protractor]** Introduced `useProtractorTo` method to access protractor API
* `tryTo` plugin introduced. Allows conditional action execution:

```js
const isSeen = await tryTo(() => {
  I.see('Some text');
});
// we are not sure if cookie bar is displayed, but if so - accept cookies
tryTo(() => I.click('Accept', '.cookies'));
```

* **Possible breaking change** In semantic locators `[` char indicates CSS selector.

Basic feature file:

```gherkin
Feature: Business rules
  In order to achieve my goals
  As a persona
  I want to be able to interact with a system

  Scenario: do anything in my life
    Given I need to open Google
```

Step definition:

```js
const I = actor();

Given('I need to open Google', () => {
  I.amOnPage('https://google.com');
});
```

Run it with `--features --steps` flag:

```
codeceptjs run --steps --features
```

---

* **Brekaing Chnage** `run` command now uses relative path + test name to run exactly one test file.

Previous behavior (removed):
```
codeceptjs run basic_test.js
```
Current behavior (relative path to config + a test name)

```
codeceptjs run tests/basic_test.js
```
This change allows using auto-completion when running a specific test.

---

* Nested steps output enabled for page objects.
    * to see high-level steps only run tests with `--steps` flag.
    * to see PageObjects implementation run tests with `--debug`.

  I.amOnPage('/hello');
  I.see('Hello!');
  session('john', () => {
    I.amOnPage('/bye');
    I.dontSee('Hello');
    I.see('Bye');
  });
  I.see('Hello');
});
```

  },
}
```

Feature('checkout')
  .timeout(3000)
  .retry(2);

Scenario('user can order in firefox', (I) => {
  // see dynamic configuration
}).config({ browser: 'firefox' })
  .timeout(20000);

## 1.1.0

Major update to CodeceptJS. **NodeJS v 8.9.1** is now minimal Node version required.
This brings native async-await support to CodeceptJS. It is recommended to start using await for tests instead of generators:

```js
async () => {
  I.amOnPage('/page');
  const url = await I.grabTextFrom('.nextPage');
  I.amOnPage(url);
}
```

Thanks to [@Apshenkin](https://github.com/apshenkin) for implementation. Also, most helpers were refactored to use async-await. This made our code simpler. We hope that this encourages more users to send pull requests!

We also introduced strict ESLint policies for our codebase. Thanks to [@Galkin](https://github.com/galkin) for that.

* **[Puppeteer] Helper introduced**. [Learn how to run tests headlessly with Google Chrome's Puppeteer](http://codecept.io/puppeteer/).
* **[SeleniumWebdriver]** Helper is deprecated, it is recommended to use Protractor with config option `angular: false` instead.
* **[WebDriverIO]** nested iframe support in the within block by **[reubenmiller](https://github.com/reubenmiller)**. Example:

```js
within({frame: ['#wrapperId', '[name=content]']}, () => {
  I.click('Sign in!');
  I.see('Email Address');
});
I.see('Nested Iframe test');
I.dontSee('Email Address');
});
```
* **[WebDriverIO]** Support for `~` locator to find elements by `aria-label`. This behavior is similar as it is in Appium and helps testing cross-platform React apps. Example:

```html
<Text accessibilityLabel="foobar">
    CodeceptJS is awesome
</Text>
```
‚Üë This element can be located with `~foobar` in WebDriverIO and Appium helpers. Thanks to **[flyskywhy](https://github.com/flyskywhy)**

* Allow providing arbitrary objects in config includes by **[rlewan](https://github.com/rlewan)**
* **[REST]** Prevent from mutating default headers by **[alexashley](https://github.com/alexashley)**. See [#789](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/issues/789)

## 1.0

CodeceptJS hits first stable release. CodeceptJS provides a unified API for [web testing for Webdriverio](http://codecept.io/acceptance/), [Protractor](http://codecept.io/angular/), and [NightmareJS](http://codecept.io/nightmare/). Since 1.0 you can also **test mobile applications** in the similar manner with Appium.

Sample test:

```js
I.seeAppIsInstalled("io.super.app");
I.click('~startUserRegistrationCD');
I.fillField('~email of the customer', 'Nothing special'));
I.see('davert@codecept.io', '~email of the customer'));
I.clearField('~email of the customer'));
I.dontSee('Nothing special', '~email of the customer'));
```

* Read [the Mobile Testing guide](http://codecept.io/mobile).
* Discover [Appium Helper](http://codecept.io/helpers/Appium/)

---

We also introduced two new **helpers for data management**.
Using them you can easily prepare and cleanup data for your tests using public REST API.

Sample test

```js
// create a user using data factories and REST API
I.have('user', { name: 'davert', password: '123456' });
// use it to login
I.amOnPage('/login');
I.fillField('login', 'davert');
I.fillField('password', '123456');
I.click('Login');
I.see('Hello, davert');
// user will be removed after the test
```

* Read [Data Management guide](http://codecept.io/data)
* [REST Helper](http://codecept.io/helpers/REST)
* [ApiDataFactory](http://codecept.io/helpers/ApiDataFactory/)

---

Next notable feature is **[SmartWait](http://codecept.io/acceptance/#smartwait)** for WebDriverIO, Protractor, SeleniumWebdriver. When `smartwait` option is set, script will wait for extra milliseconds to locate an element before failing. This feature uses implicit waits of Selenium but turns them on only in applicable pieces. For instance, implicit waits are enabled for `seeElement` but disabled for `dontSeeElement`
