## Playwright

**Extends Helper**

Uses [Playwright][1] library to run tests inside:

-   Chromium
-   Firefox
-   Webkit (Safari)

This helper works with a browser out of the box with no additional tools required to install.

Requires `playwright` or `playwright-core` package version ^1 to be installed:

    npm i playwright@^1.18 --save

or

    npm i playwright-core@^1.18 --save

Using playwright-core package, will prevent the download of browser binaries and allow connecting to an existing browser installation or for connecting to a remote one.

## Configuration

This helper should be configured in codecept.json or codecept.conf.js

-   `url`: base url of website to be tested
-   `browser`: a browser to test on, either: `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`, `electron`. Default: chromium.
-   `show`:  - show browser window.
-   `restart`:  - restart strategy between tests. Possible values:
    -   'context' or **false** - restarts [browser context][2] but keeps running browser. Recommended by Playwright team to keep tests isolated.
    -   'browser' or **true** - closes browser and opens it again between tests.
    -   'session' or 'keep' - keeps browser context and session, but cleans up cookies and localStorage between tests. The fastest option when running tests in windowed mode. Works with `keepCookies` and `keepBrowserState` options. This behavior was default before CodeceptJS 3.1
-   `timeout`:  -  [timeout][3] in ms of all Playwright actions .
-   `disableScreenshots`:   - don't save screenshot on failure.
-   `emulate`:  launch browser in device emulation mode.
-   `video`:  enables video recording for failed tests; videos are saved into `output/videos` folder
-   `trace`:  record [tracing information][4] with screenshots and snapshots.
-   `fullPageScreenshots`  - make full page screenshots on failure.
-   `uniqueScreenshotNames`:   - option to prevent screenshot override if you have scenarios with the same name in different suites.
-   `keepBrowserState`:  - keep browser state between tests when `restart` is set to 'session'.
-   `keepCookies`:  - keep cookies between tests when `restart` is set to 'session'.
-   `waitForAction`: (optional) how long to wait after click, doubleClick or PressKey actions in ms. Default: 100.
-   `waitForNavigation`: . When to consider navigation succeeded. Possible options: `load`, `domcontentloaded`, `networkidle`. Choose one of those options is possible. See [Playwright API][5].
-   `pressKeyDelay`: . Delay between key presses in ms. Used when calling Playwrights page.type(...) in fillField/appendField
-   `getPageTimeout`  config option to set maximum navigation time in milliseconds.
-   `waitForTimeout`: (optional) default wait* timeout in ms. Default: 1000.
-   `basicAuth`: (optional) the basic authentication to pass to base url. Example: {username: 'username', password: 'password'}
-   `windowSize`: (optional) default window size. Set a dimension like `640x480`.
-   `colorScheme`: (optional) default color scheme. Possible values: `dark` | `light` | `no-preference`.
-   `userAgent`: (optional) user-agent string.
-   `locale`: (optional) locale string. Example: 'en-GB', 'de-DE', 'fr-FR', ...
-   `manualStart`:  - do not start browser before a test, start it manually inside a helper with `this.helpers["Playwright"]._startBrowser()`.
-   `chromium`: (optional) pass additional chromium options
-   `electron`: (optional) pass additional electron options
-   `channel`: (optional) While Playwright can operate against the stock Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers available on the machine. In particular, current Playwright version will support Stable and Beta channels of these browsers. See [Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge][6].

#### Video Recording Customization

By default, video is saved to `output/video` dir. You can customize this path by passing `dir` option to `recordVideo` option.

-   `video`: enables video recording for failed tests; videos are saved into `output/videos` folder
-   `keepVideoForPassedTests`: - save videos for passed tests
-   `recordVideo`: [additional options for videos customization][7]

#### Trace Recording Customization

Trace recording provides a complete information on test execution and includes DOM snapshots, screenshots, and network requests logged during run.
Traces will be saved to `output/trace`

-   `trace`: enables trace recording for failed tests; trace are saved into `output/trace` folder
-   `keepTraceForPassedTests`: - save trace for passed tests

#### Example #1: Wait for 0 network connections.

     url: "http://localhost",
     show: true // headless mode not supported for extensions
     chromium: {
       userDataDir: '/tmp/playwright-tmp', // necessary to launch the browser in normal mode instead of incognito,
       args: [
          `--disable-extensions-except=${pathToExtension}`,
          `--load-extension=${pathToExtension}`
       ]
     }
   }
 }
}
```

#### Example #6: Launch tests emulating iPhone 6

```js
const { devices } = require('playwright');

{
 helpers: {
   Playwright: {
     url: "http://localhost",
     emulate: devices['iPhone 6'],
   }
 }
}
```

#### Example #7: Launch test with a specific user locale

```js

  }
 }
}
```

Note: When connecting to remote browser `show` and specific `chrome` options (e.g. `headless` or `devtools`) are ignored.
