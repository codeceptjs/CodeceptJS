## Polly

**Extends MockRequest**

This helper works the same as MockRequest helper. It has been included for backwards compatibility
reasons. So use MockRequest helper instead of this.

Please refer to MockRequest helper documentation for details.

### Installations

Requires [Polly.js][1] library by Netflix installed

    npm i @pollyjs/core @pollyjs/adapter-puppeteer --save-dev

Requires Puppeteer helper or WebDriver helper enabled

### Configuration

Just enable helper in config file:

```js
helpers: {
   Puppeteer: {
     // regular Puppeteer config here
   },
   Polly: {}
}
```

The same can be done when using WebDriver helper..

### Usage

Use `I.mockRequest` to intercept and mock requests.
