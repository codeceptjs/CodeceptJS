## CodeceptUI <Badge text="beta" type="warn"/>

CodeceptJS has an interactive, graphical test runner. We call it CodeceptUI. It works in your browser and helps you to manage your tests.

CodeceptUI can be used for

* running tests by groups or single
* get test reports
* review tests
* edit tests and page objects
* write new tests
* easily switch to headless/headful mode

CodeceptUI is a useful addon to CodeceptJS, we recommend to try.
It is an [open-source Vue-based application](https://github.com/codeceptjs/ui) which runs in your browser.
