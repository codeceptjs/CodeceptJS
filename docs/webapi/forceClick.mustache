Perform an emulated click on a link or a button, given by a locator.
Unlike normal click instead of sending native event, emulates a click with JavaScript.
This works on hidden, animated or inactive elements as well.

If a fuzzy locator is given, the page will be searched for a button, link, or image matching the locator string.
For buttons, the "value" attribute, "name" attribute, and inner text are searched. For links, the link text is searched.
For images, the "alt" attribute and inner text of any parent links are searched.

The second parameter is a context (CSS or XPath locator) to narrow the search.

```js
// simple link
I.forceClick('Logout');
// button of form
I.forceClick('Submit');
// CSS button
I.forceClick('#form input[type=submit]');
// XPath
I.forceClick('//form/*[@type=submit]');
// link in context
I.forceClick('Logout', '#nav');
// using strict locator
I.forceClick({css: 'nav a.login'});
```

@param {CodeceptJS.LocatorOrString} locator clickable link or button located by text, or any element located by CSS|XPath|strict locator.
@param {?CodeceptJS.LocatorOrString} [context=null] (optional, `null` by default) element to search in CSS|XPath|Strict locator.
