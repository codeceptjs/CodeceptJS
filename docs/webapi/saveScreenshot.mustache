Saves a screenshot to ouput folder (set in codecept.json).
Filename is relative to output folder. 
Optionally resize the window to the full available page `scrollHeight` and `scrollWidth` to capture the entire page by passing `true` in as the second argument.

```js
I.saveScreenshot('debug.png');
I.saveScreenshot('debug.png',true) \\resizes to available scrollHeight and scrollWidth before taking screenshot
```
@param fileName
@param fullPage (optional)
