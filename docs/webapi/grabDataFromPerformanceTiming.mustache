Grab the data from performance timing using Navigation Timing API.
The returned data will contain following things in ms:
- responseEnd,
- domInteractive,
- domContentLoadedEventEnd,
- loadEventEnd
Resumes test execution, so **should be used inside an async function with `await`** operator.

```js
await I.amOnPage('https://example.com');
let data = await I.grabDataFromPerformanceTiming();
//Returned data
{ // all results are in [ms]
  responseEnd: 23,
  domInteractive: 44,
  domContentLoadedEventEnd: 196,
  loadEventEnd: 241
}
```
