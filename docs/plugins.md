## actor

The reason we need to do this cause
the step actor contains this and hence
the allure reporter could not parse and
generate the report

## allure

Allure reporter

![][1]

Enables Allure reporter.

##### Usage

To start please install `allure-commandline` package (which requires Java 8)

    npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev

Add this plugin to config file:

```js
"plugins": {
    "allure": {}
}
```

Run tests with allure plugin enabled:

    codeceptjs run --plugins allure

By default, allure reports are saved to `output` directory.
Launch Allure server and see the report like on a screenshot above:

    allure serve output

##### Configuration

-   `outputDir` - a directory where allure reports should be stored. Standard output directory is set by default.

### Parameters

-   `config`  

## autoDelay

Sometimes it takes some time for a page to respond to user's actions.
Depending on app's perfromance this can be either slow or fast.

For instance, if you click a button and nothing happens - probably JS event is not attached to this button yet
Also, if you fill field and input validation doesn't accept your input - maybe because you typed value too fast.

This plugin allows to slow down tests execution when a test running too fast.
It puts a tiny delay for before and after action commands.

Commands affected (by default):

-   `click`
-   `fillField`
-   `checkOption`
-   `pressKey`
-   `doubleClick`
-   `rightClick`

##### Configuration

```js
"plugins": {
   "autoDelay": {
     "enabled": true
   }
}
```

Possible config options:

-   `methods`: list of affected commands. Can be overridden
-   `delayBefore`: put a delay before a command. 100ms by default
-   `delayAfter`: put a delay after a command. 200ms by default

### Parameters

-   `config`  

## retryFailedStep

Retries each failed step in a test.

Add this plugin to config file:

```js
"plugins": {
    "retryFailedStep": {
       "enabled": true
    }
}
```

Run tests with plugin enabled:

    codeceptjs run --plugins retryFailedStep

##### Configuration:

-   `retries` - number of retries (by default 5),
-   `when` - function, when to perform a retry (accepts error as parameter)
-   `factor` - The exponential factor to use. Default is 2.
-   `minTimeout` - The number of milliseconds before starting the first retry. Default is 1000.
-   `maxTimeout` - The maximum number of milliseconds between two retries. Default is Infinity.
-   `randomize` - Randomizes the timeouts by multiplying with a factor between 1 to 2. Default is false.

This plugin is very basic so it's recommended to improve it to match your custom needs.

### Parameters

-   `config`  

## screenshotOnFail

Creates screenshot on failure. Screenshot is saved into `output` directory.

Initially this functionality was part of corresponding helper but has been moved into plugin since 1.4

Configuration can either be taken from a corresponding helper (deprecated) or a from plugin config (recommended).

```js
"plugins": {
   "screenshotOnFail": {
     "enabled": true
   }
}
```

Possible config options:

-   `uniqueScreenshotNames`: use unique names for screenshot. Default: false.
-   `fullPageScreenshots`: make full page screenshots. Default: false.

### Parameters

-   `config`  

## stepByStepReport

![step-by-step-report][2]

Run tests with plugin enabled:

    codeceptjs run --plugins stepByStepReport

##### Configuration

```js
"plugins": {
   "stepByStepReport": {
