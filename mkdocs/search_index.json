We check \nnot just functionality of application but a user interface\n (UI) as well.\n\n\nBy default CodeceptJS uses \nWebDriverIO\n helper and \nSelenium\n to automate browser.

You just describe a test scenario with JavaScript DSL and allow the framework to handle the rest.\n\n\nWithin web page you can locate elements, interact with them, and check that expected elements are present on a page.

Practically every steps\nin WebDriverIO helper accept them both.\n\n\nI.seeElement('.user'); // element with CSS class user\nI.seeElement('//button[contains(., \npress me\n)]'); // button\n\n\n\n\nBy default CodeceptJS tries to guess the locator type.\nIn order to specify exact locator type you can pass a hash called \nstrict locator\n.\n\n\nI.seeElement({css: 'div.user'});\nI.seeElement({xpath: '//div[@class=user]'});\n\n\n\n\nStrict locators allow to specify additional locator types:\n\n\n// locate form element by name\nI.seeElement({name: 'password'});\n// locate element by text\nI.seeElement({text: 'press me'});\n// locate element by id\nI.seeElement({id: 'users'});\n\n\n\n\nClicking\n\n\nCodeceptJS provides a flexible syntax to specify an element to click.\n\n\nBy default CodeceptJS tries to find button or link with exact text on it\n\n\n// search for link or button\nI.click('Login');\n\n\n\n\nIf none found, CodeceptJS tries to find link or button containing that text. In case an image is clickable its \nalt\n attribute will be checked for text inclusion. Form buttons will also be searched by name.\n\n\nTo narrow down the results you can specify a context in second parameter.\n\n\nI.click('Login', '.nav'); // search only in .nav\nI.click('Login', {css: 'footer'}); // search only in footer\n\n\n\n\nTo skip the global search pass exact strict locator (or start locator with \n//\n or \n.\n or \n#\n).\nIn this case you are not limited to buttons and links. Any element found by that locator is clicked.\n\n\n// click element by CSS\nI.click('#signup');\n// click element located by name inside a form\nI.click({name: 'submit'}, '#user\nform');\n\n\n\n\nFilling Fields\n\n\nClicking the links is not what takes the most time during testing a web site. If your site consists only of links you can skip test automation. The most routine waste of time goes into the testing of forms. CodeceptJS provides several ways of doing that.\n\n\nLet's submit this sample form for a test:\n\n\nform method=\npost\n action=\n/update\n id=\nupdate_form\n\n     \nlabel for=\nuser_name\nName\n/label\n\n     \ninput type=\ntext\n name=\nuser[name]\n id=\nuser_name\n /\n\n     \nlabel for=\nuser_email\nEmail\n/label\n\n     \ninput type=\ntext\n name=\nuser[email]\n id=\nuser_email\n /\n\n     \nlabel for=\nuser_gender\nGender\n/label\n\n     \nselect id=\nuser_gender\n name=\nuser[gender]\n\n          \noption value=\nm\nMale\n/option\n\n          \noption value=\nf\nFemale\n/option\n\n     \n/select\n\n     \ninput type=\nsubmit\n name=\nsubmitButton\n value=\nUpdate\n /\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to fill in all those fields and click \"Update\" button. CodeceptJS matches form elements by their label, name, or by CSS or XPath locators.\n\n\n// we are using label to match user_name field\nI.fillField('Name', 'Miles');\n// we can use input name\nI.fillField('user[email]','miles@davis.com');\n// select element by label, choose option by text\nI.selectOption('Gender','Male');\n// click 'Update' button, found by text\nI.click('Update');\n\n\n\n\nAlternative scenario:\n\n\n// we are using CSS\nI.fillField('#user_name', 'Miles');\nI.fillField('#user_email','miles@davis.com');\n// select element by label, option by value\nI.selectOption('#user_gender','m');\n// click 'Update' button, found by name\nI.click('submitButton', '#update_form');\n\n\n\n\nAssertions\n\n\nIn order to verify the expected behavior of a web application, web page connects should be checked.\nCodeceptJS provides built-in assertions for that. They start with \nsee\n (or \ndontSee\n) prefix, as they describe user's current vision.\n\n\nThe most general and common assertion is \nsee\n:\n\n\n// Just a visible text on a page\nI.see('Hello');\n// text inside .msg element\nI.see('Hello', '.msg');\n// opposite\nI.dontSee('Bye');\n\n\n\n\nYou should provide a text as first argument, and optionally a locator to narrow the search context.\n\n\nYou can check that specific element exists (or not) on a page, as it was described in \nLocating Element\n section.\n\n\nI.seeElement('.notice');\nI.dontSeeElement('.error');\n\n\n\n\nAdditional assertions:\n\n\nI.seeInCurrentUrl('/user/miles');\nI.seeInField('user[name]', 'Miles');\nI.seeInTitle('My Website');\n\n\n\n\nTo see all possible assertions see the helper's reference.\n\n\nGrabbing\n\n\nSometimes you need to retrieve a data from a page to use it in next steps of a scenario.\nImagine, application generates a password and you want to ensure that user can login using this password.\n\n\nI.fillField('email', 'miles@davis.com')\nI.click('Generate Password');\nlet password = yield I.grabTextFrom('#password');\nI.click('Login');\nI.fillField('email', 'miles@davis.com');\nI.fillField('password', password);\nI.click('Log in!');\n\n\n\n\ngrabTextFrom\n action is used here to retrieve text from an element. All actions starting with \ngrab\n prefix are expected to return data. In order to synchronize this step with a scenario you should pause test execution with \nyield\n keyword of ES6. To make it work your test should be written inside a generator function (notice \n*\n in its definition):\n\n\nScenario('use page title', function*(I) {\n  // ...\n  var password = yield I.grabTextFrom('#password');\n  I.fillField('password', password);\n});\n\n\n\n\nWaiting\n\n\nIn modern web applications rendering is happen on client side.\nSometimes that may cause delays. A test may fail while trying to click an element which has not appeared on a page yet.\nTo handle this cases \nwait*\n methods introduced.\n\n\nI.waitForElement('#agree_button', 30); // secs\n// clicks a button only when it is visible\nI.click('#agree_button');\n\n\n\n\nMore wait actions can be found in helper's reference.\n\n\nSmartWait\n\n\nIt is possible to wait for elements pragmatically. If a test uses element which is not on a page yet, CodeceptJS will wait for few extra seconds before failing. This feature is based on \nImplicit Wait\n of Selenium. CodeceptJS enables implicit wait only when searching for a specific element and disables in all other cases. Thus, the performance of a test is not affected.\n\n\nSmartWait can be enabled by setting wait option in WebDriverIO config.\nAdd \n\"smartWait\": 5000\n to wait for additional 5s.\n\n\nSmartWait works with a CSS/XPath locators in \nclick\n, \nseeElement\n and other methods. See where it is enabled and where is not:\n\n\nI.click('Login'); // DISABLED, not a locator\nI.fillField('user', 'davert'); // DISABLED, not a specific locator\nI.fillField({name: 'password'}, '123456'); // ENABLED, strict locator\nI.click('#login'); // ENABLED, locator is CSS ID\nI.see('Hello, Davert'); // DISABLED, Not a locator\nI.seeElement('#userbar'); // ENABLED\nI.dontSeeElement('#login'); // DISABLED, can't wait for element to hide\nI.seeNumberOfElements('button.link', 5); // DISABLED, can wait only for one element\n\n\n\n\n\nSmartWait doesn't check element for visibility, so tests may fail even element is on a page.\n\n\nUsage example:\n\n\n// we use smartWait: 5000 instead of\n// I.waitForElement('#click-me', 5);\n// to wait for element on page\nI.click('#click-me');\n\n\n\n\nIFrames\n\n\nwithin\n operator can be used to work inside IFrames. Special \nframe\n locator is required to locate the iframe and get into its context.\n\n\nSee example:\n\n\nwithin({frame: \n#editor\n}, () =\n {\n  I.see('Page');\n});\n\n\n\n\nNested IFrames can be set by passing array \n(Nightmare only)\n:\n\n\nwithin({frame: [\n.content\n, \n#editor\n]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndone()\n\n\nCodeceptJS through helpers provides user friendly API to interact with a webpage.

            "text": "AngularJS E2E Testing with CodeceptJS\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nCodeceptJS is an acceptance testing framework. In diversified world of JavaScript testing libraries it aims to create a unified high level API for end-to-end testing, powered by differnet backends.\nCodeceptJS allows you to write a test and switch in config execution drivers: will it be \nwedriverio\n, \nselenium-webdriver\n, or \nprotractor\n depends on you.\nThis way you aren't be bound to implementation, and your acceptance tests will work no matter of framework running them.\n\n\nAs you know, \nProtractor\n is an official tool for testing AngularJS applications.\nCodeceptJS should not be considerend as alternative to Protractor but a testing framework utilizing this powerful library.\n\n\n\n\nSo there is no magic in testing of AngularJS application in CodeceptJS.\nYou just execute regular Protractor commands, packed in a simple high-level API.\n\n\n\n\nAs an example we will use popular \nTodoMVC application\n.\nHow would we test creating a new todo item in CodeceptJS?\n\n\nScenario('create todo item', (I) =\n {\n  I.amOnPage('/');\n  I.dontSeeElement('#todo-count');\n  I.fillField({model: 'newTodo'}, 'Write a guide');\n  I.pressKey('Enter');\n  I.see('Write a guide', {repeater: \ntodo in todos\n});\n  I.see('1 item left', '#todo-count');\n});\n\n\n\n\nThe similar test written in native syntax of Protractor (inherited from selenium-webdriver) would look like this:\n\n\nit('should create todo item', (I) =\n {\n  browser.get(\nhttp://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/\n);\n  expect(element(by.css(\n#todo-count\n)).isPresent()).toBeFalsy();\n  var inputField = element(by.model(\nnewTodo\n));\n  inputField.sendKeys(\nWrite a guide\n);\n  inputField.sendKeys(protractor.Key.ENTER);\n  var todos = element.all(by.repeater(\ntodo in todos\n));\n  expect(todos.last().getText()).toEqual(\nWrite a guide\n));\n  element(by.css(\n#todo-count\n)).getText()).toContain('1 items left');\n});\n\n\n\n\nComparing to the API proposed by CodeceptJS, this code looks a bit more complicated.\nBut what the more important, it's really really hard to read and follow its logic.\nReadability is the most crucial part in acceptance testing.\nYou should easily change tests when changes specification or design.\nProbably, only a person who writes Protractor tests in your company,\ncould do those changes, while CodeceptJS allows anyone to work with tests.\nContrary, CodeceptJS provides CodeceptJS provides scenario-driven approach, so test is just a step-by-step representation of real user actions.\nThis way you can easily read, and follow test scenario, and edit it when you need it to be changed.\n\n\nIn this way CodeceptJS is more similar to Cucumber, so if you run a test with \n--steps\n option you will see this output:\n\n\nTodoMvc --\n create todo item\n \u2022 I am on page \n/\n\n \u2022 I dont see element \n#todo-count\n\n \u2022 I fill field {\nmodel\n:\nnewTodo\n}, \nWrite a guide\n\n \u2022 I press key \nEnter\n\n \u2022 I see \nWrite a guide\n, {\nrepeater\n:\ntodo in todos\n}\n \u2022 I see \n1 item left\n, \n#todo-count\n\n \u2713 OK in 968ms\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Cucumber, CodeceptJS is not about writing test scenarios above for business rules.\nTo say it again, its \ngoal is to provide standard action steps you can use for testing applications\n.\nSurely, it can't cover 100% of cases but it aims for 90%, for others you can write your own steps inside a \ncustom Helper\n using API of Protractor\n\n\nSetting up CodeceptJS with Protractor\n\n\nTo start using CodeceptJS you will need to install it via NPM and initialize it in directory with tests.\n\n\nnpm install -g codeceptjs\ncodeceptjs init\n\n\n\n\nYou will be asked questions about initial configuration, make sure you select Protractor helper.\nIf you didn't have Protracotr library it \nwill be installed\n.\nPlease agree to extend steps, and use \nhttp://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/\n as a url for Protractor helper.\n\n\nFor TodoMVC application you will have following config created in \ncodecept.json\n file:\n\n\n{\n  \ntests\n: \n./*_test.js\n,\n  \ntimeout\n: 10000,\n  \noutput\n: \n./output\n,\n  \nhelpers\n: {\n    \nProtractor\n: {\n      \nurl\n: \nhttp://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/\n,\n      \ndriver\n: \nhosted\n,\n      \nbrowser\n: \nfirefox\n,\n      \nrootElement\n: \nbody\n\n    }\n  },\n  \ninclude\n: {\n    \nI\n: \n./steps_file.js\n\n  },\n  \nbootstrap\n: false,\n  \nmocha\n: {},\n  \nname\n: \ntodoangular\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nFirst test can be generated with \ngt\n command:\n\n\ncodeceptjs gt\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you can start writing your first CodeceptJS/Angular tests.\nPlease look into the reference of [Protractor helper])(http://codecept.io/helpers/Protractor/) for all available actions.\nYou can also run \nlist\n command to see methods of I:\n\n\ncodeceptjs list\n\n\n\n\nWriting First Test\n\n\nTest scenario should always use \nI\n object to execute commands.\nThis is important as all methods of \nI\n are running in global promise chain, this way CodeceptJS makes sure everything is executed in right order.\nAt first a page should be opened to proceed, we use \namOnPage\n command for that. As we already specified full URL to TodoMVC app,\nwe can pass relative path into it instead of absolute url:\n\n\nFeature('Todo MVC');\n\nScenario('create todo item', (I) =\n {\n  I.amOnPage('/');\n});\n\n\n\n\nAll scenarios should describe actions on site and assertions taken in the end.

Probably we would like not to finish with one test,\nbut have more, for testing editing of todo items, checking todo items, and more.\n\n\nLet's prepare our test for multiple scenarios. All test scenarios will need to open main page of application, so \namOnPage\n can be moved into the \nBefore\n hook:\nScenarios will probably deal with created todo items, so we can move logic of crating new todo into a function.\n\n\nFeature('TodoMvc');\n\nBefore((I) =\n {\n  I.amOnPage('/');\n});\n\nvar createTodo = function (I, name) {\n  I.fillField({model: 'newTodo'}, name);\n  I.pressKey('Enter');\n}\n\nScenario('create todo item', (I) =\n {\n  I.dontSeeElement('#todo-count');\n  createTodo(I, 'Write a guide');\n  I.see('Write a guide', {repeater: \ntodo in todos\n});\n  I.see('1 item left', '#todo-count');\n});\n\n\n\n\nand so we can add even more tests!\n\n\nScenario('edit todo', (I) =\n {\n  createTodo(I, 'write a review');\n  I.see('write a review', {repeater: \ntodo in todos\n});\n  I.doubleClick('write a review');\n  I.pressKey(['Control', 'a']);\n  I.pressKey('write old review');\n  I.pressKey('Enter');\n  I.see('write old review', {repeater: \ntodo in todos\n});\n});\n\nScenario('check todo item', (I) =\n {\n  createTodo(I, 'my new item');\n  I.see('1 item left', '#todo-count');\n  I.checkOption({model: 'todo.completed'});\n  I.see('0 items left', '#todo-count');\n});\n\n\n\n\nLocators\n\n\nLike you may have noticed, CodeceptJS doesn't use \nby.*\n locators similar to Protractor or Selenium Webdriver.\nInstead most of methods expect you to pass valid CSS or XPath. In case you don't want CodeceptJS to guess the type of locator,\nyou can specify them using so-called strict locators.

            "text": "Introduction  CodeceptJS is an acceptance testing framework. In diversified world of JavaScript testing libraries it aims to create a unified high level API for end-to-end testing, powered by differnet backends.\nCodeceptJS allows you to write a test and switch in config execution drivers: will it be  wedriverio ,  selenium-webdriver , or  protractor  depends on you.\nThis way you aren't be bound to implementation, and your acceptance tests will work no matter of framework running them.  As you know,  Protractor  is an official tool for testing AngularJS applications.\nCodeceptJS should not be considerend as alternative to Protractor but a testing framework utilizing this powerful library.   So there is no magic in testing of AngularJS application in CodeceptJS.\nYou just execute regular Protractor commands, packed in a simple high-level API.   As an example we will use popular  TodoMVC application .\nHow would we test creating a new todo item in CodeceptJS?  Scenario('create todo item', (I) =  {\n  I.amOnPage('/');\n  I.dontSeeElement('#todo-count');\n  I.fillField({model: 'newTodo'}, 'Write a guide');\n  I.pressKey('Enter');\n  I.see('Write a guide', {repeater:  todo in todos });\n  I.see('1 item left', '#todo-count');\n});  The similar test written in native syntax of Protractor (inherited from selenium-webdriver) would look like this:  it('should create todo item', (I) =  {\n  browser.get( http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/ );\n  expect(element(by.css( #todo-count )).isPresent()).toBeFalsy();\n  var inputField = element(by.model( newTodo ));\n  inputField.sendKeys( Write a guide );\n  inputField.sendKeys(protractor.Key.ENTER);\n  var todos = element.all(by.repeater( todo in todos ));\n  expect(todos.last().getText()).toEqual( Write a guide ));\n  element(by.css( #todo-count )).getText()).toContain('1 items left');\n});  Comparing to the API proposed by CodeceptJS, this code looks a bit more complicated.\nBut what the more important, it's really really hard to read and follow its logic.\nReadability is the most crucial part in acceptance testing.\nYou should easily change tests when changes specification or design.\nProbably, only a person who writes Protractor tests in your company,\ncould do those changes, while CodeceptJS allows anyone to work with tests.\nContrary, CodeceptJS provides CodeceptJS provides scenario-driven approach, so test is just a step-by-step representation of real user actions.\nThis way you can easily read, and follow test scenario, and edit it when you need it to be changed.  In this way CodeceptJS is more similar to Cucumber, so if you run a test with  --steps  option you will see this output:  TodoMvc --\n create todo item\n \u2022 I am on page  / \n \u2022 I dont see element  #todo-count \n \u2022 I fill field { model : newTodo },  Write a guide \n \u2022 I press key  Enter \n \u2022 I see  Write a guide , { repeater : todo in todos }\n \u2022 I see  1 item left ,  #todo-count \n \u2713 OK in 968ms  Unlike Cucumber, CodeceptJS is not about writing test scenarios above for business rules.\nTo say it again, its  goal is to provide standard action steps you can use for testing applications .\nSurely, it can't cover 100% of cases but it aims for 90%, for others you can write your own steps inside a  custom Helper  using API of Protractor  Setting up CodeceptJS with Protractor  To start using CodeceptJS you will need to install it via NPM and initialize it in directory with tests.  npm install -g codeceptjs\ncodeceptjs init  You will be asked questions about initial configuration, make sure you select Protractor helper.\nIf you didn't have Protracotr library it  will be installed .\nPlease agree to extend steps, and use  http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/  as a url for Protractor helper.  For TodoMVC application you will have following config created in  codecept.json  file:  {\n   tests :  ./*_test.js ,\n   timeout : 10000,\n   output :  ./output ,\n   helpers : {\n     Protractor : {\n       url :  http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/ ,\n       driver :  hosted ,\n       browser :  firefox ,\n       rootElement :  body \n    }\n  },\n   include : {\n     I :  ./steps_file.js \n  },\n   bootstrap : false,\n   mocha : {},\n   name :  todoangular \n}  First test can be generated with  gt  command:  codeceptjs gt  After that you can start writing your first CodeceptJS/Angular tests.\nPlease look into the reference of [Protractor helper])(http://codecept.io/helpers/Protractor/) for all available actions.\nYou can also run  list  command to see methods of I:  codeceptjs list  Writing First Test  Test scenario should always use  I  object to execute commands.\nThis is important as all methods of  I  are running in global promise chain, this way CodeceptJS makes sure everything is executed in right order.\nAt first a page should be opened to proceed, we use  amOnPage  command for that. As we already specified full URL to TodoMVC app,\nwe can pass relative path into it instead of absolute url:  Feature('Todo MVC');\n\nScenario('create todo item', (I) =  {\n  I.amOnPage('/');\n});  All scenarios should describe actions on site and assertions taken in the end. In CodeceptJS assertion commands have  see  or  dontSee  prefix:  Feature('Todo MVC');\n\nScenario('create todo item', (I) =  {\n  I.amOnPage('/');\n  I.dontSeeElement('#todo-count');\n});  A test can be executed with  run  command, we recommend to use  --steps  options to follow step-by-step execution:  $ codeceptjs run --steps\n\nCodeceptJS v0.3.2\nTest root is assumed to be /home/davert/demos/todoangular\nUsing the selenium server at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub\n\nTodoMvc --\n create todo item\n \u2022 I am on page  / \n \u2022 I dont see element  #todo-count   Running Several Scenarios  By writing a test in similar manner we will have a test shown in the beginning of this guide.

And it is much the same, if you test hybrid app with a web view context inside.\nHowever, mobile apps do not have URLs, Cookies, they have other features which may vary on a running platform.\n\n\nThere are mobile-only methods like:\n\n\n\n\nswipeUp\n, \nswipeLeft\n, ...\n\n\nhideDeviceKeyboard\n,\n\n\nseeAppIsInstalled\n, \ninstallApp\n, \nremoveApp\n, \nseeAppIsNotInstalled\n - Android only\n\n\n\n\nand \nothers\n.\n\n\nLocating Elements\n\n\nTo start writing a test it is important to understand how to locate elements for native mobile applications.\nIn both Android and iPhone elements are defined in XML format and can be searched by XPath locators.\n\n\nI.seeElement('//android.widget.ScrollView/android.widget.LinearLayout')'\n\n\n\n\nCSS locators are not supported in native mobile apps, you need to switch to web context to use them.\n\n\nElements can also be located by their accessability id, available both at Android and iOS.\nAccessibility id is recommended to use for locating element, as it rarely changed.\n\n\n\n\niOS uses \nUIAccessibilityIdentification\n\n\nAndroid \naccessibility id\n matches the content-description\n\n\n\n\nAdd \n~\n prefix to search for element by its accessibility id:\n\n\nI.seeElement('~startUserRegistrationButton');\n\n\n\n\nElements can also have ids, which can be located with \n#\n prefix.\nOn Android it it is important to keep full package name in id locator:\n\n\nI.seeElement('#io.selendroid.testapp:id/inputUsername');\n\n\n\n\nButtons can be matched by their visible text:\n\n\nI.tap('Click me!');\nI.click('Click me!');\n\n\n\n\nNative iOS/Android locators can be used with \nandroid=\n and \nios=\n prefixes. \nLearn more\n.\n\n\nBut how to get all those locators? We recommend to use \nAppium Inspector\n.\n\n\nFor Android you can use \nUI Automator Viewer\n bundled with Android SDK:\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Apps and Contexts\n\n\nMobile applications may have different contexts. For instance, there can be native view and web view with a browser instance in it.\n\n\nTo execute commands in context of a webview use \nwithin('webview')\n function:\n\n\nI.click('~startWebView');\nwithin('webview', () =\n {\n  I.see('Preferred car');\n  I.click('Send me your name!');\n});\n\n\n\n\nIt will locate first available webview, switch to it, and switch back to native application after.\nInside WebView all browser features are enabled: CSS locators, JavaScript, etc.\n\n\nTo set a specific context use \n{ web: 'webview.context' }\n instead:\n\n\nwithin({webview: 'MyWEBVIEW_com.my.app'}, () =\n );\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively use \nswitchToWeb\n or \nswitchToNative\n methods to switch between contexts.\n\n\nI.click('~startWebView');\nI.switchToWeb();\nI.see('Preferred car');\nI.click('Send me your name!');\nI.switchToNative();\n\n\n\n\nTo get a list of all contexts use \ngrabAllContexts\n method:\n\n\nlet contexts = yield I.grabAllContexts();\n\n\n\n\nCross-Platform Testing\n\n\nIt is often happen that mobile applications behave similarly on different platforms. Can we build one test for them? Yes!\nCodeceptJS provides a way to specify different locators for Android and iOS platforms:\n\n\nI.click({android: '//android.widget.Button', ios: '//UIAApplication[1]/UIAWindow[1]/UIAButton[1]'});\n\n\n\n\nIn case some code should be executed on one platform and ignored on others use \nrunOnAndroid\n and \nrunOnIOS\n methods:\n\n\nI.runOnAndroid(() =\n {\n  I.click('Hello Android');\n});\nI.runOnIOS(() =\n {\n  I.click('Hello iOS');\n});\n\n\n\n\nThe same code can be shared for web applications as well. To execute some code in web browser only, use \nI.runInWeb\n:\n\n\nI.runInWeb(() =\n {\n  I.amOnPage('/login'); // not available for mobile\n  I.fillField('name', 'jon');\n  I.fillField('password', '123456');\n  I.click('Login');\n  I.waitForElement('#success'); // no available for mobile\n});\n\n\n\n\nJust as you can specify android, and ios-specific locators, you can do so for web:\n\n\nI.click({web: '#login', ios: '//UIAApplication[1]/UIAWindow[1]/UIAButton[1]'});\n\n\n\n\ndone()",

Nightmare is in active development and has nice API for writing acceptance tests.\nUnfortunately, as all other JavaScript testing frameworks it has its own very custom API.\nWhat if you choose it for a project and suddenly you realize that you need something more powerful, like Selenium?\nYes, that might be a problem if you are not using CodeceptJS.\nThe one idea behind CodeceptJS is to unify different testing backends under one API, so you could easily write tests the same way no matter what engines you use: webdriverio, Protractor, or Nightmare.\n\n\nCompare a test written using Nightmare API:\n\n\nnightmare\n  .goto('http://yahoo.com')\n  .type('form[action*=\n/search\n] [name=p]', 'github nightmare')\n  .click('form[action*=\n/search\n] [type=submit]')\n  .wait('#main')\n  .evaluate(function () {\n    return document.querySelector('#main .searchCenterMiddle li a').href\n  })\n\n\n\n\nwith a similar CodeceptJS test:\n\n\n  I.amOnPage('http://yahoo.com');\n  I.fillField('p', 'github nightmare');\n  I.click('Search Web');\n  I.waitForElement('#main');\n  I.seeElement('#main .searchCenterMiddle li a');\n  I.seeElement(\n//a[contains(@href,'github.com/segmentio/nightmare')]\n);\n  I.see('segmentio/nightmare','#main li a');\n\n\n\n\nNightmareJS support only CSS locators for web elements, while CodeceptJS improves it to use XPath as well.\nThis is how form can be located by labels, and buttons by text in examples above. It is done by injecting\nclient-side scrips (for element location) to every loaded page. Also all events like click, doubleClick, keyPress are \nsimulated\n by JavaScript,\nthis makes testing less relevant, as they are not native to operating systems.\n\n\nHow Fast Is Nightmare JS?\n\n\nLet's execute the test above within WebDriverIO using headless Firefox + Selenium Server packed in Docker container.\n\n\ndocker run -d -p 4444:4444 selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0\ncodeceptjs run yahoo_test.js --steps\n\n\n\n\nThis provides use with output:\n\n\n Yahoo basic test\n \n WebDriverIO._before\n \u2022 I am on page \nhttp://yahoo.com\n\n \u2022 I fill field \np\n, \ngithub nightmare\n\n \u2022 I click \nSearch Web\n\n \u2022 I wait for element \n#main\n, 2\n \u2022 I see element \n#main .searchCenterMiddle li a\n\n \u2022 I see \nsegmentio/nightmare\n, \nli a\n\n \u2713 OK in 17591ms\n\n\n\n\nWhen we switch helper to Nightmare:\n\n\n Yahoo basic test\n \n Nightmare._before\n \u2022 I am on page \nhttp://yahoo.com\n\n \u2022 I fill field \np\n, \ngithub nightmare\n\n \u2022 I click \nSearch Web\n\n \u2022 I wait for element \n#main\n, 2\n \u2022 I see element \n#main .searchCenterMiddle li a\n\n \u2022 I see \nsegmentio/nightmare\n, \nli a\n\n \u2713 OK in 5490ms\n\n\n\n\nAs you see the Nightmare test was almost \n3 times faster\n than Selenium test.\nSure, this can't be taken as a valuable benchmark but more like a proof of concept.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nTo start you need CodeceptJS with nightmare and nightmare-upload packages installed.\n\n\nnpm install -g codeceptjs-nightmare\n\n\n\n\nAnd a basic project initialized\n\n\ncodeceptjs init\n\n\n\n\nYou will be asked for a Helper to use, you should select Nightmare and provide url of a website you are testing.\nSetup process is explained on \nQuickStart page\n.\n\n\n(If you already have CodeceptJS project, just install nightmare globally or locally and enable it in config)\n\n\nConfiguring Nightmare\n\n\nTo enable Nightmare tests you should enable \nNightmare\n helper in \ncodecept.json\n config:\n\n\n{ // ..\n  \nhelpers\n: {\n    \nNightmare\n: {\n      \nurl\n: \nhttp://localhost\n,\n      \nshow\n: false,\n      \nrestart\n: false\n    }\n  }\n  // ..\n}\n\n\n\n\nTurn on the \nshow\n option if you want to follow test progress in a window.

For instance, CodeceptJS provides \nhaveHeader\n method\nto set default headers for all your HTTP requests:\n\n\nI.haveHeader('x-tested-with', 'codeceptjs');\n\n\n\n\nWhen opening a web page you can set headers as well. \namOnPage\n methods can take headers as second parameter:\n\n\n// use basic http auth\nI.amOnPage('/admin', [{'Authorization': 'Basic '+token}]);\n\n\n\n\nAs a small bonus: all \nconsole.log\n calls on a page will be also shown in \n--debug\n mode.\n\n\nManipulating Web Page\n\n\nNightmare helper is supposed to work in the same manner as WebDriverIO, SeleniumWebdriverJS or Protractor.\nThis means that all CodeceptJS actions like \nclick\n, \nfillField\n, \nselectOption\n and others are supposed to work in the very same manner.\nThey are expressive and flexible to accept CSS, XPath, names, values, or strict locators. Follow the helper reference for detailed description.\n\n\nAssertions start with \nsee\n prefix.

It is recommended to set \nendpoint\n, a base URL for all API requests.\nIf you need some authorization you can optionally set default headers too.\n\n\nSee the sample config:\n\n\nhelpers\n: {\n  \nREST\n: {\n    \nendpoint\n: \nhttp://localhost/api/v1/\n,\n    \ndefaultHeaders\n: {\n      \nAuth\n: \n11111\n\n    }\n  },\n\n  \nWebDriverIO\n : {\n    \nbrowser\n: \nchrome\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nREST helper provides basic methods to send requests to application:\n\n\nI.sendGetRequest()\nI.sendPostRequest()\nI.sendPutRequest()\nI.sendPatchRequest()\nI.sendDeleteRequest()\n\n\n\n\nAs well as a method for setting headers: \nhaveRequestHeaders\n.\n\n\nHere is a usage example:\n\n\nlet postId = null;\n\nScenario('check post page', function*(I) {\n  // valid access token\n  I.haveRequestHeaders({auth: '1111111'});\n  // get the first user\n  let user = yield I.sendGetRequest('/api/users/1');\n  // create a post and save its Id\n  postId = yield I.sendPostRequest('/api/posts', { author: user.id, body: 'some text' });\n  // open browser page of new post\n  I.amOnPage('/posts/2.html');\n  I.see('some text', 'p.body');\n});\n\n// cleanup created data\nAfter((I) =\n {\n  I.sendDeleteRequest('/api/posts/'+postId);\n});\n\n\n\n\nThis can also be used to emulate Ajax requests:\n\n\nI.sendPostRequest('/update-status', {}, { http_x_requested_with: 'xmlhttprequest' });\n\n\n\n\nData Generation with Factories\n\n\nThis concept is extended by \nApiDataFactory\n helper.\nIt builds data according to defined rules and uses API to store them and automatically clean them up after a test,\nThis way setting data for a test is as simple as writing:\n\n\nlet post = yield I.have('post');\nI.haveMultiple('comment', 5, { postId: post.id});\n\n\n\n\nJust define how many items of any kind you need and ApiDataFactory will create them for you.\nHowever, to make this work some preparations required.\n\n\nAt first, you need data generation libraries which are \nRosie\n and \nFaker\n. Faker can generate random names, emails, texts, and Rosie uses them\nto generate objects using factories.\n\n\nInstall rosie and faker to create a first factory:\n\n\nnpm i rosie faker --save-dev\n\n\n\n\nThen create a module which will export a factory for an entity.\n\n\nSee the example providing a factory for User generation:\n\n\n// factories/post.js\nvar Factory = require('rosie').Factory;\nvar faker = require('faker');\n\nmodule.exports = new Factory()\n  .attr('name', () =\n faker.name.findName())\n  .attr('email', () =\n faker.internet.email());\n\n\n\n\nNext is to configure helper to match factories with API:\n\n\n \nApiDataFactory\n: {\n   \nendpoint\n: \nhttp://user.com/api\n,\n   \nfactories\n: {\n     \nuser\n: {\n        \nuri\n: \n/users\n\n        \nfactory\n: \n./factories/user\n\n     }\n   }\n }\n\n\n\n\nThen, calling \nI.have('user')\n inside a test will create a new user for you.\nThis is done by sending POST request to \n/api/users\n URL. Response is returned and can be used in tests.\n\n\nAt the end of a test ApiDataFactory will clean up created record for you. This is done by collecting\nids from crated records and running \nDELETE /api/users/{id}\n requests at the end of a test.\nThis rules can be customized in helper configuration.\n\n\n\n\ndone()",

Depending on the mode you can have different information printed using corresponding functions.   default : prints basic information using  output.print  steps : toggled by  --steps  option, prints step execution  debug : toggled by  --debug  option, prints steps, and debug information with  output.debug  verbose : toggled by  --verbose  prints debug information and internal logs with  output.log   It is recommended to avoid  console.log  and use output.* methods for printing.  const output = require('codeceptjs').output;\n\noutput.print('This is basic information');\noutput.debug('This is debug information');\noutput.log('This is verbose logging information');  Container  CodeceptJS has a dependency injection container with Helpers and Support objects.\nThey can be retrieved from the container:  let container = require('codeceptjs').container;\n\n// get object with all helpers\nlet helpers = container.helpers();\n\n// get helper by name\nlet WebDriverIO = container.helpers('WebDriverIO');\n\n// get support objects\nlet support = container.support();\n\n// get support object by name\nlet UserPage = container.support('UserPage');  New objects can also be added to container in runtime:  let container = require('codeceptjs').container;\n\ncontainer.append({\n  helpers: { // add helper\n    MyHelper: new MyHelper({ config1: 'val1' });\n  },\n  support: { // add page object\n    UserPage: require('./pages/user');\n  }\n})  Container also contains current Mocha instance:  let mocha = container.mocha();",

Selenium Installation   Download  Selenium Server  For Chrome browser install  ChromeDriver ,\n    for Firefox browser install  GeckoDriver .  Launch the server:  java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.xx.xxx.jar . To locate Chromedriver binary use\n     -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=./chromedriver  option. For Geckodriver use  -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver= .   PhantomJS Installation  PhantomJS is a headless alternative to Selenium Server that implements the WebDriver protocol.\nIt allows you to run Selenium tests on a server without a GUI installed.   Download  PhantomJS  Run PhantomJS in WebDriver mode:  phantomjs --webdriver=4444   Configuration  This helper should be configured in codecept.json   url  - base url of website to be tested  browser  - browser in which perform testing  restart  (optional, default: true) - restart browser between tests.  smartWait : (optional)  enables  SmartWait ; wait for additional milliseconds for element to appear. Enable for 5 secs: \"smartWait\": 5000  keepCookies  (optional, default: false)  - keep cookies between tests when  restart  set to false.  windowSize : (optional) default window size. Set to  maximize  or a dimension in the format  640x480 .  waitForTimeout : (option) sets default wait time in  ms  for all  wait*  functions. 1000 by default;  desiredCapabilities : Selenium's  desired\n    capabilities  manualStart  (optional, default: false) - do not start browser before a test, start it manually inside a helper\n    with  this.helpers[\"WebDriverIO\"]._startBrowser()  timeouts :  WebDriverIO timeouts  defined as hash.   Example:  {\n    helpers : {\n      WebDriverIO  : {\n        smartWait : 5000,\n        browser :  chrome ,\n        restart : false,\n        windowSize :  maximize ,\n        timeouts : {\n          script : 60000,\n          page load : 10000\n       }\n     }\n   }\n}  Additional configuration params can be used from  webdriverio\nwebsite .  Connect through proxy  CodeceptJS also provides flexible options when you want to execute tests to Selenium servers through proxy.

            "text": "CodeceptJS hits first stable release. CodeceptJS provides a unified API for  web testing for Webdriverio ,  Protractor , and  NightmareJS . Since 1.0 you can also  test mobile applications  in the similar manner with Appium.  Sample test:  I.seeAppIsInstalled( io.super.app );\nI.click('~startUserRegistrationCD');\nI.fillField('~email of the customer', 'Nothing special'));\nI.see('davert@codecept.io', '~email of the customer'));\nI.clearField('~email of the customer'));\nI.dontSee('Nothing special', '~email of the customer'));   Read  the Mobile Testing guide .  Discover  Appium Helper    We also introduced two new  helpers for data management .\nUsing them you can easily prepare and cleanup data for your tests using public REST API.  Sample test  // create a user using data factories and REST API\nI.have('user', { name: 'davert', password: '123456' });\n// use it to login\nI.amOnPage('/login');\nI.fillField('login', 'davert');\nI.fillField('password', '123456');\nI.click('Login');\nI.see('Hello, davert');\n// user will be removed after the test   Read  Data Management guide  REST Helper  ApiDataFactory    Next notable feature is  SmartWait  for WebDriverIO, Protractor, SeleniumWebdriver. When  smartwait  option is set, script will wait for extra milliseconds to locate an element before failing. This feature uses implicit waits of Selenium but turns them on only in applicable pieces. For instance, implicit waits are enabled for  seeElement  but disabled for  dontSeeElement   Read more about  SmartWait   Changelog   Minimal NodeJS version is 6.11.1 LTS  Use  within  command with generators.
